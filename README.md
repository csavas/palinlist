# palinlist
Take a list of Strings and store the Strings in a Queue and in a Stack.  Use the Stack and Queue to determine if the list of Strings is a palindrome.   A palindrome list would be a list that had the same words going forward as going backwards.  A B A would be a palin list.   A B C would not be a palin list.
